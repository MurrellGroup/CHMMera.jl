- `queries::Vector{String}`: A vector of query sequences.

- `bw::Bool = true`: A boolean indicating whether to use the Baum-Welch or the Discretized Bayesian approach.

- `base_mutation_probability::Float64 = 0.05`: The base mutation probability. Used as starting point for Baum-Welch.
- `prior_probability::Float64 = 0.02`: The prior probability of a sequence being chimeric.

Compute the recombination events for a query sequence given a set of reference sequences.

The return type is a vector of `RecombinationEvents` (plural because one query can have multiple recombination events).
In RecombinationEvents, `recombinations` is a vector of `RecombinationEvent`s, each of which contains `position`, `left`, `right`, `left_state`, and `right_state` (Since FullHMMs have multiple states per reference).
`startingpoint` is the starting point of viterbi path, `pathevaluation` is the probability of the second most probable reference, and `logsiteprobabilities` is the log probability of being at each site in the query sequence (forward * backward).
If the argument `detailed` is false, only `recombinations` is computed.

# Arguments
- `queries::Vector{String}`: A vector of query sequences.
- `references::Vector{String}`: A vector of reference sequences.

- `prior_probability::Float64 = 0.02`: The prior probability of a sequence being chimeric.
- `detailed::Bool = false`: A boolean indicating whether to calculate `pathevaluation` and `logsiteprobabilities`.
